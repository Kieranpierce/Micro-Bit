# Micro-Bit
 A Collection of Microbit Python scripts

# Astroids
This is a simple version of the clasic asteriod dodging game. The pilot commands the ship using the Micro:Bit A and B buttons. The object is to score as many points as possible by dodging the falling astroids. Each astroid scroes 1 point. Once enough points has been scroed the player advances to the next level. With each new level comes a new chalange to avoid more and more astroied at once. 

Level 6 and above is very hard

Once the Game starts press the A button to begin or the B Button to see the last Level and Scrore scroll across the screen.
